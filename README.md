# TopDownShooter
This repository is a Unity 2D project - a personal playground of mine. This file is a hybrid of a GitHub readme and a design doc.  
TL;DR - **A fast-paced top-down shooter with satisfying controls**

The project goals
-----------------
- (personal) Learning basic Unity 2D workflow & scripting
- Arcade-feeling (**high-score** maxing potential)
- **Pick-up-and-play** game
- A few challenges (**achievements**) for replayability

The blurry feature list
-----------------------
- Smooth, **satisfying** and **fast-paced** movement
- **Enjoyable combat** (shooting) system
- Basic follow-and-shoot **enemy AI**
- 10 short (3-4 min each) **stages with speedrun potential**
More info about the plans and WIPs can be found in the project's Trello board over [here](https://trello.com/b/INs7XlZy)

Opening the project files
-------------------------
**If you want to open the entire project** (recommended), you'll need the Unity Editor.  
This project uses Unity version 2020.3.12f1. Slightly older or newer versions might work, but it's best to open it on its native version.  
You can download the Unity Hub [here](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal)  
When you've installed Unity Hub, install the correct version in the "Installs" tab, then open the project by clicking "Open" in the "Projects" tab.  
After that, you can simply open the Hub and choose the project from the list.  
**Important**: Unity uses a proprietary license - read it with care before agreeing to it

**If you just want to have a look at the C# code**, you don't need any extra tools.  
Just go to `projectroot/Assets/Scripts` and open any of the `.cs` files there with any text editor.  
Using the Unity Editor in conjunction is advised, but not required.  
**Disclaimer**: None of the code is properly commented, so to understand it, you might need to look step-by-step at portions of it  

**Built releases of the project** will be available as GitHub releases **when all the core gameplay** features are **implemented**.
